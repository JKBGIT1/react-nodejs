## About project

This project is running on [https://www.netlify.com/](Netlify) this [https://myrestaurantsweb.netlify.app/](link).

It was build in [https://reactjs.org/](React). I used [https://material-ui.com/](Material-UI) library for design. Data about restaurants are fetched from [https://developers.zomato.com/api?lang=sk](Zomato API).

This site is connected with my own [https://github.com/JKBGIT1/react-nodejs-server](server) and stores data about users on [https://www.mongodb.com/](MongoDB).
