## About project

This project is running on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) this [link](https://myrestaurantsweb.netlify.app/).

It was build in [React](https://reactjs.org/). I used [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library for design. Data about restaurants are fetched from [Zomato API](https://developers.zomato.com/api?lang=sk).

This site is connected with my own [server](https://github.com/JKBGIT1/react-nodejs-server) and stores data about users on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

This website does't support GDPR so you shouldn't enter your personal data, when your are singing up. I don't take responsibility for your privacy.
